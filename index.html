                        HISTORY OF THE GIANT ANGORA RABBIT
                    </h3>                   
                    The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ABRA) recognises four different breeds of Angora rabbit namely:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>French</li>                    </li>
                        <li>English</li>
                        <li>Satin</li>
                        <li>Giant</li>
                    </ul>
                    The Satin Angora has finer and softer hair compared to the other breeds and the Giant Angora, which we will on this guide, is the biggest of the breeds.
                    <br/>
                    A fiffth variety of  Angora rabbit breed, the German Angora, is recognised by the international Association of German Angora Rabbit Breeders.
                    <br/>
                    The Angora wool industry has been criticized by animal right activists for many years. They claim that rabbits are scared and injured in the process of harvesting the wool. Due to their wonderful coats, the Angora is a very popular show breed and is often hard to beat.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>
                        Breed Origin
                    </h3>                    
                    The Angora rabbits originates from Ankara, Turkey(previously known as Angora) and is one of the oldest type of the wooly rabbits. When thes rabbits firt came to the United States, at first there was just one type of Angora rabbit, known as the""Angora Wooler".
                    <br/>
                    In 1931, the Angora Wooler was reclassified as two types of rabbits, the English Angora and the French Angora. The Satin Angora was then created by crossing the Satin and French Angora rabbit and the Giant Angora was created by breeding the English Angora rabbit with Flemish Giants.

                    Louise Walsh of Taunton, Massachusetts wanted to create an Angora that was was different from the other Angora breeds of rabbits. The Giant Angora was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) in 1988.

                    <h3>Characteristics of Giant Angora rabbit</h3>
                    
                    The Giant Angora is a very impressive breed! These rabbits are large, with big, fluffy coats that certainly make them stand out from the crowd. Not only does this make them popular at rabbit shows, but often this fur used to make clothes such as socks and mittens.
                    
                    A Giant Angora rabbit can set you back anywhere between $50 and $250, if not more! Because of their show-quality and their wool that can be sheared and then sold on, they are one of the more expensive breeds.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    
                    The Giant Angora rabbit is the largest of all the Angora breeds. These rabbits usually weigh between 9.5 and 10 lbs. They have a commercial body type with a large oval head that is broad on the forehead and slightly narrower at the muzzle. They have forehead tufts and cheek furnishings and their ears are long and stand upright.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>COAT</h3>
                    
                    This is what the Giant Angora rabbit is known for! Out of all the Angora breeds recognized by ARBA, the Giant Angora produces the most wool. They have three different kinds of fiber in its wool: soft underwool (gentle waves and shine), awn fluff (crimped with a hooked end) and awn hair (guard hairs which are strong and straight).
                    
                    As a companion rabbit, the Giant Angora should be taken to the groomers a few times a year to have their coat clipped. This and regular brushing can help to prevent matting. We will go into more detail about grooming the Angora later on.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Color</h3>
                    
                    The Angora’s coat can come in a range of colors. The color your Angora will be will depend on what color group they are in. These groups include the agouti group, white group, broken group, shaded group and self group. The most common colors are white, black, blue, chocolate, blue tort, black tort, chocolate, tort, and chestnut.
                    
                    However, the only color that is accepted by the ARBA is REW (ruby-eyed white). These are also known as albino rabbits.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Temperament</h3>
                    
                    The Giant Angora rabbit has a friendly and laid-back nature, like most rabbits, yet they need plenty of time with their owners to socialize and bond. These bunnies don’t like to be locked up in their hutch for long periods of time and will much prefer to be around you.
                    
                    Once bonded to you, the Giant Angora rabbit is your friend for life! They can get on well with everyone, children included. Socialization should be continued throughout their life so they become a well-rounded rabbit.
                    
                    You should always respect your Angora’s personal space, especially when they are new to your home. If they are afraid or frightened, then they might try to bite.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Lifespan</h3>
                    
                    The Giant Angora rabbit has a life expectancy of between 7 and 12 years. This is relatively long for a rabbit!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Known health issues</h3>
                    
                    These bunnies can live a long and happy life when looked after correctly. However, like all rabbits, the Giant Angora can be prone to some health conditions. These health problems are mostly related to their large coat.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Woolblock — this can be a serious and sometimes fatal issue within the Angora. As they clean and groom themselves, they can ingest fur which can become trapped inside the digestive system and create a furball. Unlike cats, rabbits cannot regurgitate furballs and it will become bigger and bigger. This can lead to loss of appetite as your rabbit will believe they are full, or it can block the digestive tract.
                    </li>
                    <li>Overheating — this is due to their fluffy coat. Ensure you groom them correctly and keep them out of the sun.
                    </li>
                    <li>Diarrhea — this is something all rabbits deal with, especially when they eat too much fresh food, especially sugary fruits and not enough hay. However, you’ll need to clean your Angora properly if they experience diarrhea because it can get trapped within their coat. Make sure they are throughly dry after any kind of washing otherwise moisture can become trapped against their skin which will lead to other health issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>Malocclusion — this is when the upper and lower teeth are misaligned so that the normal process of chewing doesn’t wear down your rabbit’s teeth. Regular dental checkups are very important. You should also make sure your rabbit eats plenty of hay.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    Like all rabbits, they can also suffer from back issues if they are mishandled or accidentally dropped, particularly because of their size.
                    
                    Regular vet checkups will ensure that you catch any health problems before they become too serious. You should also make sure that you are buying from a reputable breeder.

                    <h2>The Flemish Giant rabbit</h2>
                    <br/>
                    It is the largest breed of domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus). Flemish Giants are historically a utility breed used for their fur and meat. They are often kept as pets as they are known for being docile and patient when being handled.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>History</h3>                   
                    The Flemish Giant originated in Flanders. It was bred as early as the 16th century near the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is believed to have descended from a number of meat and fur breeds, possibly including the Steenkonijn ("Stone Rabbit"—referring to the old Belgian weight size of one stone or about 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb)) and the European "Patagonian" breed (now extinct).[1] This "Patagonian" rabbit, a large breed that was once bred in Belgium and France, was not the same as the Patagonian rabbit of Argentina (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), a wild species of a different genus weighing less than 0.9 kilograms (2.0 lb),[2] nor the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), sometimes called the Patagonian hare, a species in the cavy family of rodents that cannot interbreed with rabbits.[3] Thomas Coatoam, in his Origins of the Flemish Giants, states that "The earliest authentic record of the Flemish Giant Rabbit occurred about the year 1860."[4]
                                     
                    The first standards for the breed were written in 1893. The Flemish Giant is an ancestor of many rabbit breeds from all over the world, one of which is the Belgian Hare,[1] which was imported into England in the mid-19th century. The Flemish Giant was exported from England and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to increase the size of meat rabbits during the great "rabbit boom".[5]

                    The breed received little attention until about 1910, when it started appearing at small livestock shows throughout the country. Today, it is one of the more popular breeds at rabbit shows due to its unusually large size and varying colors. It is promoted by the National Federation of Flemish Giant Rabbit Breeders, which was formed in 1915. The Flemish Giant has many nicknames, including the "Gentle Giant" for its uniquely docile personality, and the "universal rabbit" for its varied purposes as a pet, show, breeding, meat, and fur animal.[4]

                    Flemish giants are also popular as pets, especially in Europe and North America. Although they are large they are known to exhibit cleanliness and can be trained to use a litter box.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    As one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbit, the Flemish Giant is a semi-arch type rabbit with its back arch starting behind the shoulders and carrying through to the base of the tail, giving a "mandolin" shape. The body of a Flemish Giant Rabbit is long and powerful, with relatively broad hindquarters. The fur of the Flemish Giant is glossy and dense. When stroked from the hindquarters to the head, the fur will roll back to its original position.

                    Bucks have a broad, massive head in comparison to does, and can take 1.5 years to reach full maturity. Does may have a large, full, evenly carried dewlap (the fold of skin under their chins), and can take 1 year to reach full maturity.

                    Flemish Giant rabbits weigh 6.8 kilograms (15 lb) on average, though the largest ones can weigh up to 10 kilograms (22 lb). The longest one on record (which holds the record for the longest rabbit in the world of any kind), measured about 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) long.[6]

                    The American Rabbit Breed Association (ARBA) standard recognizes seven different colors for the breed: black, blue, fawn, sandy, light gray, steel gray, and white.[7] The show standard minimum weight for a senior doe is 6.4 kilograms (14 lb), and the show standard minimum weight of a senior buck is 5.9 kilograms (13 lb). The world's largest rabbit is Darius, a Flemish Giant rabbit that weighs 49 lb (22 kg) and measures 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in).[citation needed]

                    <br/>
                    <h3>Behaviour and lifestyle</h3>                   
                    Flemish Giants can be docile and tolerant of being handled if they frequently have interactions with humans. Flemish Giants, like all rabbits, can become fearful and sometimes aggressive if handled incorrectly or irresponsibly. Their larger frame requires that one handling a Flemish Giant pay special attention to its spine alignment. Consequently, potential owners should consider these factors in addition to their size, level of food consumption, and substantial waste production before deciding to get one as a pet.

                    Due to its large size, the Flemish Giant needs substantial living quarters that provide ample opportunity for physical movement. The House Rabbit Society recommends keeping rabbits inside the home in a very large pen or room(s) in the home. Larger dog crates are often more appropriate than traditional rabbit and small-pet cages, which tend to be smaller and shorter. In the United States Department of Agriculture's standards for animal housing, rabbits over 5.4 kilograms (12 lb) must have at least 0.46 square metres (5.0 sq ft) of floor space.[8] The size of appropriate living quarters increases with size of the rabbit.

                    Cages with incorrectly sized wire gauge bottoms (as opposed to small gauge wire or solid bottoms) can harm the feet of a Flemish Giant more so than smaller house rabbits due to their increased weight. A resting board may be required to prevent sore hocks for a larger breed rabbit.[4] The Flemish Giant will require larger quantities of food compared to smaller breeds of domestic rabbits. Like some other short hair breeds of rabbits, the Flemish Giant will usually require mild attention to grooming due to its shorter hair. Shedding during the spring and fall transition periods tend to be the most dramatic, with smaller sheds often occurring in between.

                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    Flemish Giants can be fed like other rabbits, with the amount of food increased to match their larger size.[9] ARBA recommendations include hay and occasional treats.

                    A high protein diet of 16% enables the rabbit to gain bone mass while it is growing, and later in gaining muscle mass. Small amounts of apples, cabbage, or broccoli given as treats and slowly increased do not harm the health of the rabbit; for instance, a rabbit consuming a quarter of an apple every other day can safely be fed half an apple with the same frequency after three weeks. (However, feeding the apple core or seeds to the rabbit may be harmful.)[further explanation needed] Flemish Giants do not reach full size until they are 1.5 years old, and consume a large amount of food during this time. After females deliver kits, and during winter for all Flemish Giants, the rabbits must be fed as much as they can eat, and given plenty of water.

                    Obesity due to overfeeding is a major health concern for both commercial and pet rabbits. Excess protein, calories, and minerals such as salt and calcium, often provided when the rabbit-owner is supplementing a commercial diet, can also cause kidney stones.[10]

                    The House Rabbit Society recommends two cups of chopped leafy vegetables per 2.7 kilograms (6.0 lb) of body weight and no more than two tablespoons of fruit or carrots per 2.7 kilograms (6.0 lb) of body weight daily.[11]

                    <h3>Breeding</h3>
                    The American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA) recommends delaying breeding of female rabbits until they reach the senior weight range. For Flemish Giants, this is 6.4 kilograms (14 lb), and a typical rabbit will reach this weight when they are about 9 months to one year.[10] A Flemish Giant can take up to 1.5 years to reach their maximum weight and a breeder should wait until the rabbit is slightly over a year old before breeding. Females and males can become sexually mature at 4 months and 8 days. Once the rabbits are 3 months old they should be kept in separate cages or put females with females and males with males. If fighting occurs then they must be separated. The breeding lifespan of a rabbit is variable. Some breeders prefer not to have any more litters after the age of three years,[12] while others continue to produce quality litters for five to eight years. The gestation period is between 28–31 days. On average they give birth at 30–32 days. The Flemish Giant rabbit can produce large litters, usually between 5 and 12 in a litter.

                    Uses. Rabbits tend to be bred for one of four things: meat, fur, show, or pet use. The Cinnamon rabbit is referred to as the "All-Purpose Rabbit", because it fulfills all four of these purposes.

                    The New Zealand is a breed of rabbit, which despite the name, is American in origin. The breed originated in California, possibly from rabbits imported from New Zealand. 
                    <br/> New Zealand rabbits are available in five colors recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA): white, red, black, blue, and broken. Crossbreeding can result in many other variations, such as gold tipped steel and chestnut agouti. 
                    <br/> They average 10–12 lb (4.5–5.4 kg) with the does being slightly larger than the bucks. New Zealands are bred for meat, pelts, show, and laboratory uses, being the most commonly used breed of rabbit both for testing and meat production. They are also bred as pet rabbits but mostly breed for meat.

                    <h3>Origins</h3>
                    The New Zealand White actually originated in the United States and was bred in 1916 by a Californian breeder seeking to develop a valuable rabbit for the meat and fur trade. It is unknown which breeds of rabbit he used but the name is thought to stem from wild New Zealand rabbits, and the texture and quality of the fur suggests the use of Angoras. The New Zealand White was exported to Britain after World War II, where it became popular with breeders and also as a laboratory rabbit. The New Zealand Black and New Zealand Blue were developed in Britain but these varieties are far less common than the original White.
